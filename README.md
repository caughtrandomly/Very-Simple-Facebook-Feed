<h1>Very Simple Facebook Feed</h1>
<p>This very simple Facebook Feed pulls the timeline of a certain user and allows you to create, style and customize it!</p>
<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Within the next few days I'll write a better README file!</p>
<h2>How does it work?</h2>
<p>1. Simply replace the client vairable located on the 9th line!</p>
<p>2. Start styling, check Facebook documentation to see what you can call!</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<code><?= $post->message; ?></code>
